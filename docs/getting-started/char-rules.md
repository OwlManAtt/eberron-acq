# Character Creation & Rules
You may draw upon all official DnD sourcebooks to create your character.

Downtime tasks will follow the rules found in the Acquisitions, Inc (AI) sourcebook, which expands upon the rules found in Xanathar's Guide to Everything (XGtE) and the core rulebook.

:::warning I have no idea what the hell any of that means
Downtime activities are what you do between adventures. Once you get your franchise up and running, you're going to have staff who'll always be able to do downtime activities like crafting, selling, spying, etc.

But don't sweat it. It won't matter for a few levels.

If you pick something that is specific to another setting ([example](https://www.dndbeyond.com/backgrounds/azorius-functionary)), you will need to come up with a reasonable story adaptation to Eberron.

## Preparing Yourself
If you are not familiar with DnD, you should review the DnD Core Rulebook. Don't stress about memorizing the rules. Your character sheet will list what actions you have available in combat, which is enough of a reminder that *stuff exists* for you to ask how to use things as they sound relevant. For the most part, you roll a d20 and the DM tells you what happens. It'll work out.

You should read the introduction to the Aquisitions, Inc. book, as well as the *Playing with Class* section. You can review the Wayfinder's Guide to Eberron (WGtE) to get an idea of the setting. 

:::warning I don't want to read all of that
OK.

The bare minimum is reading the blurbs on the [campaign details page](./README.md), and enough of the core rulebook to know what the words on your character sheet mean. Information you should know about major historical events will be provided on an as-needed basis as we play the game.

If you've played any RPGs at all, you're gunna be *fine*.

You can discover a fair amount through the DnD Beyond character sheet. It will include relevant rules and background with your race, class, background, skill, spell, etc selections. That may be less of a pain in the ass.

## Character Creation
I recommend using [DnD Beyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/)'s character sheet tool. Joining the DnD Beyond campaign will grant you access to all of the sourcebook DLC options.

On the first step of the character creation process, select these options:

- Sources
    - Enable 'Homebrew Content' (for self-made magic items -- it will be quite clear when you're doing this)
    - Enable 'Playtest Content' (WotC's playtest material)
    - Disable 'Magic: The Gathering Content' (*unless you want to play a race from the Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica*)
- Advancement Type = Milestone
- Point Buy on step 3 for your ability score generaion method

Note that some races have a non-traditional backstory in Eberron. Consult the Wayfinder's Guide to Eberron (WGtE) for the details. If you want to play a race that is not found in the WGtE, consult the 'Other Races' section for suggestions on how to fit them in to the world. Every race can be put in to Eberron.

We will be starting at level 1. You do **not** need to pick a company position (for your franchise) yet. It's just normal character creation. Do what DnD Beyond says and you're golden.

There are a couple of options that I will draw attention to:

- [Warforged](https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/warforged) are kind-of-magic not-robot robot people
    - This race is unique to Eberron
- The [Artificer class](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/artificer) is currently in playtest & is not in the core rulebook, but is a valid option!
    - It was introduced as part of the Eberron setting in earlier versions of DnD, and was just recently ported to 5e
    - Because it's playtest, it is liable to change
    - The version of the Artificer supported by DnD Beyond will be what we use -- they're usually ~2weeks behind any updates to the class that WotC releases
- Acquisitions, Inc has [some backgrounds](https://www.dndbeyond.com/backgrounds?filter-name=&filter-source=44) (like *Failed Merchant* or *Rival Intern*) that will suit the campaign very well

### Backstory
The most crucial part of character creation is not your race, class, or stats. It's your character's story.

Consider what led you to the life you currently live. Where did you come from? How were you affected by the gigantic 100-year-long war that ended with a country randomly exploding for no reason? Why did you apply for an internship with Acquisitions, Inc.?

Backstory should be submitted to the DM. It can be as short or long as you want. If you can, try to give the DM some hooks to work into the campaign -- old rivals, debts, goals, or anything else that can be used to put your character in the spotlight for a little while.

### Advancement
We are using milestone level-ups, so the DM will tell you when it's time. You do not need to track XP or anything tedious like that.

The campaign will move you up to level 3 at a relatively quick pace, and then the level-ups will slow down a bit. Level 3 is when every class gets to make an exciting, build-defining choice for your character.

Feel free to multiclass or do whatever insane things you want. DnD Beyond will hold your hand with leveling up.

Upon successful conclusion of your internships for the Head Office, you will be able to establish your franchise. At this point, you will need to select a company position. DnD Beyond does not (currently) track this, so there will be a little bit of effort involved. You get really cool stuff, so it's worth it!

At certain points, your franchise will "level up" as well, and the group will need to determine how to upgrade it.

## House Rules
I've noticed a tendency for combat to drag on and on. This isn't so bad when everyone is together at a physical table and able to bullshit, but it feels very lonely waiting for your turn with an online game. 

I will introduce one house rule to speed combat along: the Escalation Die, [adapted from the 13th Age SRD](https://www.13thagesrd.com/combat-rules/#Escalation_Die).

As DM, I reserve the right to drop this or modify it if I find it isn't producing the desired effect.

### Escalation Die
The escalation die represents a bonus to attacks as the fight goes on.

At the start of the second round, the DM sets the escalation die at 1. Players gains a bonus to attack rolls equal to the current value on the escalation die. Each round, the escalation die advances by +1, to a maximum of +4.

Most monsters and NPCs do not add the escalation die bonus to their attacks (*but beware bosses or other noteworthy encounters*).

If the DM judges that the characters are avoiding conflict rather than bringing the fight to the bad guys, the escalation die doesn't advance. If combat virtually ceases, the escalation die resets to 0.

:::tip What does this mean?
After the first round, you get an increasing bonus to hit enemies. Hitting enemies means you will deal damage and kill them faster.

You are supposed to be heroes, so it's kind of embarassing for a fight to last 40 minutes because you never bothered to learn how a bow actually works.
