Don't stress about memorizing the rules. Your character sheet will list what actions you have available in combat, which is enough of a reminder that <em>stuff exists</em> for you to ask how to use things as they sound relevant. For the most part, you roll a d20 and the DM tells you what happens. It'll work out.</p> <p>You should read the introduction to the Aquisitions, Inc. book, as well as the <em>Playing with Class</em> section. You can review the Wayfinder's Guide to Eberron (WGtE) to get an idea of the setting.</p> <div class="custom-block warning"><p class="custom-block-title">I don't want to read all of that</p> <p>OK.</p> <p>The bare minimum is reading the blurbs on the <a href="/getting-started/" class="router-link-active">campaign details page</a>, and enough of the core rulebook to know what the words on your character sheet mean.

Consult the Wayfinder's Guide to Eberron (WGtE) for the details. If you want to play a race that is not found in the WGtE, consult the 'Other Races' section for suggestions on how to fit them in to the world. Every race can be put in to Eberron.</p> <p>We will be starting at level 1. You do <strong>not</strong> need to pick a company position (for your franchise) yet. It's just normal character creation.

It's your character's story.</p> <p>Consider what led you to the life you currently live. Where did you come from? How were you affected by the gigantic 100-year-long war that ended with a country randomly exploding for no reason? Why did you apply for an internship with Acquisitions, Inc.?</p> <p>Backstory should be submitted to the DM. It can be as short or long as you want. If you can, try to give the DM some hooks to work into the campaign -- old rivals, debts, goals, or anything else that can be used to put your character in the spotlight for a little while.</p> <h3 id="advancement"><a href="#advancement" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Advancement</h3> <p>We are using milestone level-ups, so the DM will tell you when it's time. You do not need to track XP or anything tedious like that.</p> <p>The campaign will move you up to level 3 at a relatively quick pace, and then the level-ups will slow down a bit. Level 3 is when every class gets to make an exciting, build-defining choice for your character.</p> <p>Feel free to multiclass or do whatever insane things you want. DnD Beyond will hold your hand with leveling up.</p> <p>Upon successful conclusion of your internships for the Head Office, you will be able to establish your franchise. At this point, you will need to select a company position. DnD Beyond does not (currently) track this, so there will be a little bit of effort involved. You get really cool stuff, so it's worth it!</p> <p>At certain points, your franchise will &quot;level up&quot; as well, and the group will need to determine how to upgrade it.</p> <h2 id="house-rules"><a href="#house-rules" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> House Rules</h2> <p>I've noticed a tendency for combat to drag on and on. This isn't so bad when everyone is together at a physical table and able to bullshit, but it feels very lonely waiting for your turn with an online game.</p> <p>I will introduce one house rule to speed combat along. As DM, I reserve the right to drop this or modify it if I find it isn't producing the desired effect.</p> <h3 id="inspired-players"><a href="#inspired-players" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Inspired Players</h3> <p>You gain 3 inspiration at the start of every session. At the end of the session, you lose any unspent inspiration.</p> <p>The rules for inspiration cab be found in the PhB in chapter 4.
