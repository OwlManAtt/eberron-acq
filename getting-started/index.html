You'll be fighting against the cartels, other franchises, small family-owned farms, eldrich horrors, and sometimes your own boss using all the legal, violent, and/or accounting tricks in the employee handbook.</p> <p>But you won't be alone: the Head Office will (mostly) be there to support you. Your vast hordes of wealth (once acquired) will let you hire all the bat-wielding redcaps you need to keep the competition in line.

But where most would gaze upon that arrangement and see an inescapable life of unfulfillment, Ominifis Hereward “Omin” Dran saw a business opportunity. Thus was Acquisitions Incorporated born.

Acq hopes that these refugees will be early adopters for their newest customer-centric approach to delivering value. They have been the trojan horse that allowed Acq to thrive in marketplace normally dominated by established cartels.</p> <p>Legal filings suggest that the Head Office is preparing to take things to the next level. According to the grapevine, Acq is preparing to open the kimono (so to speak) and scale the business out by selling franchise licenses to adventurers who share their corporate values.</p> <p>They've sent up the flag and are taking on a big crop of interns for a mysterious job, and it is believed that some of these lucky adventurers will be the next generation of Acquisitions, Incorporated.</p> <blockquote><p>No, you don’t understand.
